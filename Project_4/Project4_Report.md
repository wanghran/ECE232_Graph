The most dominant genre calculated using the scoring function are different from the most frequenty genre by coount. The reason is that, the normalization used in the scoring function removes the bias. For exmple, Drama is usually a very dominant genre. So many movies in the community have the same Drama genre. Therefore, it is not intuitive to compare the count directly. So the scoring function is a better indication of the dominant genre since the frequency is normalized.
