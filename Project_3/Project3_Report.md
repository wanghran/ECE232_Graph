## Question 4
According to the plot from question 3, the closer a state is to the bottom right state, the higher the optimal value of that state is. Since the bottom right corner, from reward function 1, has the biggest reward comparing to all the other states, it is quite obvious that each state value, from that corner to the other three, should decrease gradually as going further from the bottom right.  
## Question 5

![Optimal policy](plots/Wang/Q5.png)
The plot clearly shows that the optimal policy is to get to the bottom right, which has the highest reward. 

[comment]: # (It might not be possible to get the optimal action by only observing the neighbor.)
