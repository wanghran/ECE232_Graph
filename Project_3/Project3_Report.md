## Question 19

From the graph, we can see that lambda associated with maximum accuracy is  0.8917 and the accuray value is 0.61. The plot shows that there is a global minimum when the l1 regularization term is around 1.5. The relationship between lambda and accuracy is not linear or resembles any low degree polynomials.
